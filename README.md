# BMFontCreator
A Bitmap character creator 

This application, created out of necessity, allows you to create bitmap fonts sized to your requirements.  It is primarily intended for use with microcontrollers that utilise graphical displays.  The size, font and space around the characters can be adjusted and on completion you can export the characters to a c++ header file for inclusion in a project.
